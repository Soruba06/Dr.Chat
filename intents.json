Do not flush the wound with water or try to suck out the venom.\n\n5. **Immobilize the Area**: Use a splint to immobilize the limb but do not apply ice or a tourniquet. Ensure the splinting is loose enough to allow for swelling.\n\n6. **Mark the Bite Area**: Use a pen to mark the edge of the swelling and note the time. This helps medical professionals assess the progression of envenomation.\n\n7. **Monitor Vital Signs**: Keep an eye on the victim’s breathing, pulse, and responsiveness. Be ready to perform CPR if necessary.\n\n8. **Seek Emergency Medical Help**: Call emergency services immediately. Provide as much information as possible about the snake, including its color, size, and any distinctive markings if it’s safe to do so.\n\n9. **Do Not Apply Remedies**: Do not apply ice, tourniquets, or try to cut the wound.
