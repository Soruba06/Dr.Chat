Web based AI first aid provider 

1..idea

2.dataset:-This folder likely contains datasets used for training, validating, or testing your machine learning models.

3.model(firstaid_steps.h5):-This file is a saved Keras model, which may be trained to predict or provide first aid steps based on user input 
                            or symptoms.
                            It includes the model's architecture, weights, and training configuration.
                            
4.chatbot_model.h5:-This is another Keras model, likely trained to handle the conversational logic of your chatbot, including intent 
                    recognition or response generation.

5.symptoms_trining.h5:-This file likely contains a Keras model trained to predict health conditions or analyze symptoms provided by users.

6.config.py:-A Python configuration file, typically used to store application settings, API keys, file paths, or other variables used across 
             your project.

This files are not include in this repository. Because this files are contain large file size. so ignore it. and also model(firstaid_steps.h5),chatbot_model.h5,symptoms_trining.h5 are need to train the model and automaticaly created by that training part(sympotoms_trining.py,train_model_image.py,train_model.py).
